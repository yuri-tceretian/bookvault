"""The single backend state machine for everything the app can be *doing*.

Historically this logic lived in the browser: app.js owned an `activity`
enum, a `stopRequested` flag, and the entire paced size-check loop, while
the backend only tracked the download job's own status. That split meant
the rules for "what can run at once / which button is live / when to pace a
request" were spread across the frontend and had to be re-derived there.

They belong here instead, for one concrete reason: the backend has exactly
*one* dedicated Playwright worker thread (thread-affinity -- see
session.py), so at most one real activity can run at a time anyway. This
module makes that implicit constraint the explicit contract:

    IDLE -> REFRESHING  -> (CHECKING) -> IDLE     (reload the library list)
    IDLE -> CHECKING                  -> IDLE     (paced per-book size sweep)
    IDLE -> PREPARING                 -> IDLE     (build the download zip)
    IDLE -> SYNCING                   -> IDLE     (on-disk ABS library sync)
    CHECKING/PREPARING/SYNCING -> STOPPING -> IDLE (cancel the current activity)

Only one activity may be in flight; `refresh`/`check_sizes`/`prepare`/
`start_sync` all no-op (return False) if the state isn't IDLE. When an
activity finishes it returns to IDLE and records the outcome in `result`
(done | cancelled | error) plus a human `message`, so the UI can show
"what just happened" while sitting idle. The frontend polls `snapshot()`
and renders whatever state it reports -- it owns no activity logic of its
own.

Cancellation is cooperative. Between books/size fetches the loop checks the
cancel event, and *within* a download `client.download_file` polls it
between streamed chunks -- so a Stop interrupts an in-flight transfer within
a fraction of a second (the partial file is discarded), rather than having
to wait for a possibly ~2GB audiobook to finish. `client.download_file`
still uses a bounded timeout as a backstop for a transfer that stalls
without delivering any bytes to interrupt on.

      track STORED under a per-book folder. No re-compression, and no nested
      zip signature to confuse the parser.
    - Any other member that is *itself* a zip (epub, fb2.zip, fb3, ...): keep
      it as one file but DEFLATE it, which rewrites the bytes so the nested
      signatures no longer appear raw. These are small, so it's cheap.
    - Everything else (m4b, mp3, pdf, txt, mobi): add STORED -- it has no
      nested zip signature, so storing it is both safe and free.
