"""Client for litres.ru driven through a real Chromium session (Playwright).

Plain `requests` POSTs to the login endpoint get rejected with a generic
"Incorrect user data" error regardless of whether the credentials are right
-- litres.ru sets DataDome-style bot-protection cookies (`__ddg9_`,
`__ddg1_`) that only a real, JS-executing browser can obtain. So login is
driven through an actual headless Chromium page (filling the real login
form, confirmed selectors: `input[name=email]` then `input[name=pwd]`).

Being logged in isn't enough either: the API gateway also requires a set of
app-level headers (`app-id`, `session-id`, `client-host`, `ui-currency`,
`ui-language-code`, `ab-tests-flags`, `basket`, `wishlist`,
`safemode-enabled`, ...) that the site's own frontend code attaches to every
call -- Playwright's request client doesn't add these on its own, and they
aren't things a script can safely invent (they 403 with "PermissionMissing"
if missing/wrong). So right after login we capture the header set from a
request the site's *own* JS makes automatically (`GET .../users/me`) and
replay it on subsequent calls -- this is our own already-authenticated
traffic, just reused, not a forged fingerprint.

Endpoints and response shapes below were all confirmed against a real
account: `GET .../users/me/arts` (paginated via `payload.pagination.next_page`,
items in `payload.data`), `GET .../arts/{id}/files/grouped` (format options
grouped under `payload.data[].files[]`), and
`GET /download_book/{art_id}/{release_file_id}/{name}.{ext}` (streams the
actual file -- verified against a real purchased epub).
